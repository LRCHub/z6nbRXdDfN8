There's no time to be naive
The days of lies are over and done
Tug on all the strings of faith
Oh, wait and see, the game has just begun
Even if I'm surrounded by trap and hate, I'll dodge 'em all
Okay (Okay!)
Alright (Alright!)
No one can stop my survival days

Get away from (Stone Ocean!)
I don't wanna say (There's no chance!)
Let's get started, count (One, two, three!)
Take me far away (Fly, Stone Free!)

As long as I am being real to myself
(Got to be tough)

Break out, I'm wide awake
Not gonna turn back to whom I was before
Break out, won't escape
Light up the skills, I'll be stronger even more

Limits are bye-bye, my heart's on standby
Until the faith is on my side
I don't stop beating
Don't stop beating
Don't stop beating 'em up!

If they try to drag me in
A mixed up world so full of bad jokes
I'm the only savior
Oh, wait and see, the game has just begun

Even G-O-D had made
Plan and a scenario
Okay (Okay!)
Alright (Alright!)
I'll crash and smash and build it up again

Get away from (Stone Ocean!)
I don't wanna say (There's no chance!)
Let's get started, count (One, two, three!)
Take me far away (Fly, Stone Free!)

You could never find the word surrender in my book
(Ain't nobody stop)

Break out, let's go wild
Not gonna look down, aim for hope and faith
Break out, won't escape
I'll rise from the ashes like a phoenix

Toughness from spirit, growing up in top speed
Until the fate is in my hands
I don't stop beating
Don't stop beating
Don't stop beating 'em up

(It's finally over)
(The last opening)
(I'm free)

Break out, I'm wide awake
Not gonna turn back to whom I was beforе
Break out, won't escapе
Light up the skills, I'll be stronger than before

Limits are bye-bye, my heart's on standby
Until the faith is on my side
I don't stop beating
Don't stop beating
Don't stop beating 'em up!
